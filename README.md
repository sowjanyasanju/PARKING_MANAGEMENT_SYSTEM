The problem at hand is the inefficiency and lack of control in managing parking spaces in various environments,
including airports, universities, hospitals, and city centers. Traditional parking management systems often struggle
with user experience, revenue collection, and enforcing parking regulations. This project aims to address these issues
and develop an efficient assembly language-based parking management system.
The Assembly Language Parking Management System (ALPMS) project aims to transform how parking spaces
are managed in different locations. It focuses on improving the experience for users, making it easier to collect parking fees, and enforcing parking rules more effectively. ALPMS uses assembly language, a low-level programming
approach, to create a highly optimized and efficient system
